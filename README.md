## How do I add my own Toenail?
### Method 1
1. Download the source
2. Copy the Toenail Folder
3. Change up the textures
4. (Optional) Change up the model (IMPORTANT: DO NOT EDIT THE RIG IN THE SLIGHTEST. Adding objects to the rig is fine but do not change the bone names or the bones.)
5. Create a new branch.
6. Add your new toenail to that branch.
7. Create a new pull request.

### Method 2
1. Download the source
2. Copy the Toenail Folder
3. Change up the textures
4. (Optional) Change up the model (IMPORTANT: DO NOT EDIT THE RIG IN THE SLIGHTEST. Adding objects to the rig is fine but do not change the bone names or the bones.)
5. Zip up your new Toenail into a zip and DM it to me on discord and I'll add it.
